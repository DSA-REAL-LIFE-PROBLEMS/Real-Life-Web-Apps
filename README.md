=====================================

View : https://dsa-real-life-problems.github.io/The-art-of-data-structures-and-algorithms/


What is this all about?
----------------
This project is focused on solving some real-life problems. The project consists of 6 small apps that are implemented using data structures and algorithms. This project has the application of data structures such as heaps,2d arrays, LinkedList, stacks, and algorithms like greedy and graph

Technologies Used
-------
* Html5
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Vis.js
* Phaser.js
